overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a wellesley graduating class the president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed no debate so far as i could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to be kind of the like the democratic primaries in 2016 minus the terms unknown then even at a seven sisters school i am very glad that miss adams made it clear that what i am speaking for today is all of us the 400 of us miss rodham told her classmates after appointing herself edger bergen to the charlie mccarthys and mortimer snerds in attendance the

since reconstruction edward brooke came in for criticism for calling for empathy for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics though clinton in her senior thesis on saul alinsky lamented black power demagogues and elitist arrogance and repressive intolerance within the new left similar words coming out of a republican necessitated a brief rebuttal trust rodham ironically observed in 1969 this is one word that when i asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them everyone came up to me and said talk about trust talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others talk about the trust bust what can you say about it what can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted the trust bust certainly busted clinton s 2016 plans she certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her after whitewater travelgate the vast conspiracy benghazi and the missing emails clinton found herself the distrusted voice on friday there was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons and distrust from the american people trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to november s election stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a lie a con alternative facts and a assault on truth and reason she failed to explain why the american people chose his lies over her truth as the history majors among you here today know all too well when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society she offered that is not hyperbole like so many people to emerge from the 1960s hillary clinton embarked upon a long strange trip from high school goldwater girl and wellesley college republican president to democratic politician clinton drank

for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible now as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the white house she wonders how her current station is even possible why aren t i 50 points ahead she asked in september in may she asks why she isn t president the
